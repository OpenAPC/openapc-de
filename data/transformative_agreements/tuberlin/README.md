### RSC: Publish and READ 

TU Berlin has entered a Publish and Read Agreement with Royal Society of Chemistry (via TIB National Consortium), cf. [info ESAC ("RSC2018tib")](https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/rsc2018tib/) resp. [info ESAC ("rsc2021tib")](https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/rsc2021tib/) and [publisher](https://www.rsc.org/journals-books-databases/open-access/read-and-publish/) - start date was January 1st, 2019.

APC or rather PAR fee data is reported for 2019 and 2020. It was calculated as total PAR amount (reading fee + publishing fee, as of RSC financing model) divided by the number of eligible articles (TU Berlin corresponding author). 

For 2019 the University Library is unaware of opt-out articles, 30 articles were published open access in 2019 as part of this agreement. TU Berlin paid 71.341,51 EUR (incl. VAT) in total, hence the "equivalent APC" amounts to 2.378,05 EUR.

For 2020 the University Library is unaware of opt-out articles, 26 articles were published open access in 2020 as part of this agreement. TU Berlin paid 75.678,95 EUR (incl. VAT) in total, hence the "equivalent APC" amounts to 2.910,73 EUR.

For 2021 the University Library is unaware of opt-out articles, 25 articles were published open access in 2021 as part of this agreement. TU Berlin paid 70.628,61 EUR (incl. VAT) in total, hence the "equivalent APC" amounts to 2.825,14 EUR.

For 2022 the University Library is unaware of opt-out articles (1 article was transitioned to OA after first publication). 14 articles were published open access in 2022 as part of this agreement. TU Berlin paid 80.061,82 EUR (incl. VAT) in total, hence the "equivalent APC" amounts to 5.718,70 EUR.
