The present dataset contains information only on publication fees paid from the budget of Heidelberg University's open access publishing fund from 2014 to March 2017. So it does not contain comprehensive cost information on Heidelberg University's expenditures for open access APC's. 
Heidelberg University's fund is part of DFG’s Open Access Publishing Programme.  Due to a pre-pay membership with BioMed Central (leading to a discount of 20% on publication fees from this publisher) some funding applications from 2016 are still pending, because the respective article manuscripts are still under review. Thus, the present dataset is not complete for 2016 yet. More comprehensive data will be released as soon as possible. For more information please see the fund's website mentioned above.
